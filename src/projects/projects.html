							<h3>Post Memory</h3>
							<p>I have been designing and building the website for a Nelson based augmented 
								reality heritage project called Post Memory, which will showcase the stories 
								available as well as the team behind the project.

							<h3>Clanmate Evaluator</h3>
							<p>I built a Python program that evaluates the performance of a player in the 
								game Clash of Clans. It uses the Clash of Clans API to get the player's 
								statistics for each member in a clan, then uses a formula to calculate a 
								contribution score.

							<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
							<p>The website you are using right now is a static website that I created for my 
								NMIT WEB503 course and have been updating since. It is a 
								portfolio website that I created to showcase my skills and projects.

							<h3>Discord Bot</h3>
							<p>Discord is an important communication platform for me, so I built a simple bot 
								for my friend group, in order to explore the Discord API. It has a list of basic 
								commands it responds to.

							<h3>J+ Coding Language</h3>
							<p>I was curious about how programming languages work, so I built my own 
								called J+. It is a simple language that I built using Python. It is 
								still a work in progress, having little functionality.
